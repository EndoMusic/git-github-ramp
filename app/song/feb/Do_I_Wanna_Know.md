1. This slow building rocker was debuted by the Arctic Monkeys at their May 2013 Ventura,
 California gig on the band's US Tour. It was released on iTunes on June 19, 2013.
2. Sonically, the song has a similar guitar riff to the Arctic Monkeys' "R U Mine?
" single but is more down tempo. The neo-psychedelia, stoner Rock groove is reminiscent of the Josh Homme-produced tracks on their Humbug album.
3.The song debuted at #11 on the UK singles chart, the band's best placing since "Fluorescent Adolescent" peaked at #5 in 2007. 
4. Speaking with Zane Lowe on his BBC Radio 1 show, frontman Alex Turner explained that he borrowed the AM album title 
from another band. "I actually stole it from the Velvet Underground, I'll just confess that now and get it out of the way. The 'VU' record, obviously," he said.
5. "Did we cop out?," he added. "Yeah! Summat about it feels like this record is exactly where we should be right now. So it felt right to just initial it.
""Did we cop out?," he added. "Yeah! Summat about it feels like this record is exactly where we should be right now. So it felt right to just initial it."
6. Turner told Zane Lowe regarding AM's direction: "The record sort of started with 'R U Mine?' really.
 [We] discovered something through the recording of that tune that we thought was worth exploring. 
'Do I Wanna Know' was the first thing we found along that road."
